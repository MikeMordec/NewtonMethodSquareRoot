# NewtonMethodSquareRoot
This code consists of a JUnit test class named JunitTest and a Java class named Newton. The JUnit test class contains test methods to validate the functionality of the Compute method in the Newton class, which calculates the approximate square root of a number using Newton's method.

The JunitTest class contains three test methods:

    -testComputePositive: Tests the Compute method with a positive number and asserts that the result is approximately equal to the square root of the input.
    -testComputeNegative: Tests the Compute method with a negative number and asserts that the result is Float.NaN.
    -testComputeZero: Tests the Compute method with zero and asserts that the result is zero.

The Newton class defines the Compute method, which implements Newton's method to approximate the square root of a given number. It also contains a main method that prompts the user to enter a number and then prints the approximate square root of that number.

The code demonstrates how to write unit tests using JUnit and implement Newton's method for calculating square roots in Java.
